Task Manager is a project management tool that helps teams and individuals stay organized and efficiently manage tasks. It provides the ability to create workspaces, projects, boards, and task cards.

## Features
* Workspaces: Users can create workspaces to categorize their projects and tasks. Each workspace acts as a container for related projects.
* Projects: Inside each workspace, users can create projects to group related tasks together. Projects help in organizing and tracking progress.
* Boards: Within each project, users can create boards to represent different stages or categories of tasks. Boards provide a visual representation of progress and allow easy organization.
